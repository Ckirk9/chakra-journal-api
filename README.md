# chakra-journal-api
This app is designed to promote mindful living and to empower users with the skills and knowledge to balance their own Chakras. Itâ€™s essentially a Chakra journal, that provides recommendations based on how the user is feeling mentally, physically, and energetically.

This app will require the user to register with a username and password and then login. During registration users will select their recommendation preferences. Once logged in the User will be able to access their profile and take the 12 question Chakra assessment form. This assessment can be taken as often as the user wishes. Once the assessment is complete the user will be provided with a list of the Chakras that are out of balance. Each Chakra will have recommendations on how to balance: mantra, guided meditation, yoga poses, or nature therapy. During registration the user can select which recommendations and these preferences can be updated by the user at any time. The user can also use the app to journal how they are feeling. The user can look back at previous entries, edit or delete their journal entries. Users with Administrator access can delete User profiles, and update the static Chakra data to add yoga poses or additional information to the app. Users will also be able to view a list of Yoga Teachers and Reiki healers and can contact them for private sessions.
