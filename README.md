# chakra-journal-api
This app is designed to promote mindful living and to empower users with the skills and knowledge to balance their own Chakras. Itâ€™s essentially a Chakra journal, that provides recommendations based on how the user is feeling mentally, physically, and energetically.

This app will require the user to register with a username and password and then login. Once logged in the User will be able to access their profile and take the 11 question Chakra assessment form (Check In). This assessment can be taken as often as the user wishes. Once the assessment is complete the user will be provided with a list of the Chakras that are out of balance. Each Chakra will have recommendations on how to balance: mantra, guided meditation, yoga poses, or nature therapy. The user can also use the app as a journal, the journal entries will have full CRUD functionality.  

Technologies Used: Passport, Javascript, React, Express, Mongodb, Mongoose, Node, Bootstrap
